# Static Performance Report

### Tools Used
Yslow, Pagespeed Tools

The suggestions these two tools gave us had the least amount of overlap, so therefore we decided together they provided a good general measurement of our optimizations

### Initial state of the site
When using Yslow, our site actually recieved an A as the original score, although it was the lowest A possible (90).  There were 4 change suggestions that we did not get an A on.
